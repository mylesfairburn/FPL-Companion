    """Ranks team pairs by how well their EASY WEEKS ALTERNATE, so a manager
    who owns a cheap player from each always has at least one good fixture to
    field. This is a deliberate rethink of the old 'lowest combined average'
    approach, which just surfaced the strongest one or two clubs as everyone's
    partner (they're the easier pick almost every week, so they 'carried' every
    pairing).

    Two ideas fix that:

    1. Drop the auto-starters. The `exclude_top_n` teams with the easiest
       fixtures overall (Man City, Arsenal, ...) are the ones you'd never bench
       anyway - they're set-and-forget starters, not rotation candidates. This
       also naturally biases the pool toward cheaper mid-table teams, which is
       where the interchangeable budget picks actually live.

    2. Score by the WORST week, then by genuine alternation. `worst_week` is the
       hardest fixture your better option still faces in any gameweek - keeping
       it low is exactly 'never stuck with no one to play'. Ties break on
       `improvement` (how much rotating beats just always starting the stronger
       single team), so a pair whose good weeks genuinely swap outranks one team
       quietly carrying a passenger.

    Lower difficulty = easier throughout (matches build_rotation_table)."""
