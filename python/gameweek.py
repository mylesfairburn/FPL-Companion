"""The season clock: what gameweek is it, and has a deadline just passed.

Everything time-sensitive in the app reads from here rather than deriving its
own answer, so there's one definition of "the gameweek reset".

Deadlines are irregular by design in FPL - midweek rounds land Tue/Wed evening,
an early Saturday kickoff pulls the deadline to 11:00, international breaks skip
weeks entirely, and double/blank gameweeks compress or drop rounds. So nothing
here assumes a weekly cadence or a fixed day: `deadline_time` from the live
events feed is the only source of truth, and the watcher polls hourly rather
than trying to predict when to look.
