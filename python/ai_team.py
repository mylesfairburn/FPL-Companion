"""AI Best-XV: generate, freeze and read back the per-gameweek optimum squad.

The tab is stateless by design - each gameweek gets a fresh optimum with no
carry-over, no bank and no transfers. That's what separates it from the AI
Manager (which plays by real rules and reuses manager_team instead).

Snapshots freeze `predicted_points` and `cost` at generation time and are never
recomputed. If the model improves mid-season and we re-derived old snapshots
from it, every "AI predicted X, actually scored Y" comparison in the history
would retroactively change - which would make the tab worthless as a record.
