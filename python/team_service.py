"""
Team view service for FPL Companion.

Everything here uses the PUBLIC FPL API (no login), so it can READ a manager's
team, points, bank, leagues and history - but it CANNOT write changes back to
FPL (transfers/lineup changes need an authenticated session). The optimise /
captain / transfer endpoints therefore return recommendations only; applying
them to the real team is done by the user in the FPL app.

Free-transfer count and "chips available" are not exposed by the public API, so
both are DERIVED here (walk the history / infer from used chips) and flagged as
estimates in the response.
