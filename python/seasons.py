"""Per-season data layout, and the rules for which seasons feed which job.

Everything under data/ is addressed through here rather than by hardcoded path,
so adding a season is creating one directory - no code edit, no renaming a
"previous_season_*" file into place each August.

    data/
      seasons/
        2025-26/
          gameweek_stats.csv     per-gameweek player rows (the training target)
          players.csv            season's element list
          teams.csv              season's teams
          fixtures.csv           season's fixtures
        2026-27/
          ... same, plus:
          bootstrap.json         full bootstrap-static payload (offline fallback)
          element_summaries/     per-player /element-summary/ cache
      reference/                 season-independent (positions, ClubElo)
      models/                    trained model bundles

A completed season's directory is READ-ONLY to the app. Only the current
season's files are ever written, so last season's training data can't be
clobbered by a live fetch - which is exactly what used to happen when the
element-summary cache and the current-season pull shared one folder.
