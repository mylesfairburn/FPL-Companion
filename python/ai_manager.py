"""The AI Manager: a persistent bot that plays the real game, week to week.

Where AI Best-XV re-picks from scratch every gameweek with no consequences,
this one carries a squad forward and lives with its decisions - it has a bank,
a free-transfer count, point hits, and one set of chips for the season. It's
stored as a manager with the reserved sentinel `fpl_id 0`, reusing
manager_team/manager_team_picks rather than a parallel schema.

Two things drive the policy, both of which follow from the fact that a transfer
is permanent while a fixture is not:

  * Players are valued over a HORIZON, not on the next gameweek. Buying the
    best one-week captain and selling him a fortnight later burns 4 points and
    a free transfer. `horizon_value()` weights the coming gameweeks with a
    decay, so a player with three good fixtures beats one with a single great
    one and a wall afterwards.

  * Chips are planned against the whole remaining fixture list and re-planned
    every week. Double gameweeks (a team playing twice) and blank gameweeks (a
    team not playing) are what actually make chips valuable, and the fixture
    list shows both long before they arrive.

Nothing here writes to the real FPL game - there's no authenticated API. It's a
simulation whose picks are recorded so its record can be compared against the
Best-XV and against real managers.
