"""SQLite persistence for FPL Companion.

Scope, deliberately narrow: this DB holds ONLY the time-series state that
doesn't exist anywhere else - which squad a manager (or the AI) had in a given
gameweek, and what it was predicted/actually scored. Player master data (names,
teams, cost, ratings) is NOT duplicated here. Rows carry `element_id` and are
joined against the existing pandas/CSV pipeline at read time, so there's one
source of truth for who a player is.

Two processes touch this file: the live web app (reads) and the cron jobs
(writes). WAL mode is therefore not optional - without it a writer blocks every
reader for the duration of its transaction.

The file itself must live OUTSIDE the Docker image. The GH Actions -> ghcr.io
-> docker pull cycle replaces the image wholesale on every deploy, so an
in-image DB would be silently wiped each time. FPL_DB_PATH points at a mounted
volume in production; the default is repo-root ./state/ for local runs.
