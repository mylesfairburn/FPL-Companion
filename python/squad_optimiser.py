"""Budget-constrained squad selection, as an integer linear program.

This is not an extension of team_service._optimise(). That takes a squad you
already own and orders it into a legal XI plus bench; this picks WHICH 15
players to own in the first place, under a budget and a per-club cap.

Why an ILP and not a greedy pass: the constraints interact. "Best points per
million, position by position" can spend the budget early and then be unable to
fill the last forward slot, or hit the 3-per-club cap on a team it already took
three cheap defenders from and be forced into a strictly worse fix. A solver
handles the interaction directly and returns a provably optimal squad, which
also means the number this tab reports is meaningful rather than "whatever the
heuristic happened to find".

Squad picking and lineup picking are solved TOGETHER in one model rather than
"pick 15, then pick the best 11 from them". Those give different answers: the
best 15 by total value is not the 15 whose best 11 scores highest, because only
the starters (and a doubled captain) actually score.

PuLP ships its own CBC binary, so there's no system solver to install.
