"""Scheduled jobs, run from the Proxmox host's cron (see deploy/README).

    python jobs.py deadline-watch    # hourly
    python jobs.py daily-refresh     # ~03:00 UK

Two jobs rather than one, because they answer to different clocks:

  deadline-watch has to be timing-accurate. FPL deadlines land at irregular
  times and days (midweek rounds, 11:00 Saturday starts, blank/double weeks),
  so there's no daily slot that reliably lands just after one. Hourly polling of
  `deadline_time` catches them all, and the work is cheap enough to do 24x/day.

  daily-refresh is the heavy pipeline run, and wants to be LATE rather than
  timely: a Monday night game can finish ~22:00 and FPL's bonus-point
  finalisation (`data_checked`) often lags full time by an hour or more, so a
  literal midnight run risks freezing provisional scores.

Both run as a separate process from the web app. The app deliberately runs a
single worker holding rated data in an in-memory `state` dict, so these jobs
must not import-and-mutate that state - they write to SQLite, then poke
/api/refresh so the live process reloads.
