"""Per-gameweek history for real managers.

Populated only for FPL ids someone has actually looked up (see
db.known_manager) - there are ~11M FPL entries and no reason to hold any but
the handful this instance serves.

FPL's own API already exposes a manager's picks for past gameweeks, so this
isn't the only copy of that data. What it adds is the frozen `predicted_points`
per pick: the model's view at the time, which FPL obviously doesn't store and
which can't be reconstructed later once ratings move on. That's what makes
"what we predicted vs what happened" answerable.
