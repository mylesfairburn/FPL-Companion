"""The squad a manager is working on in this app, stored server-side.

Keyed on FPL id alone, so the same team follows you between devices. This
replaces the old per-device localStorage draft.

The lifecycle mirrors the real game:

  * Before a deadline you edit the draft freely. It's yours, it's provisional,
    and it lives for the gameweek named in `gameweek`.
  * When that deadline passes the hourly watcher overwrites it with the picks
    you actually made in the official FPL game and re-points it at the next
    gameweek. Whatever you'd been experimenting with here is gone, because from
    that moment your real team is the only thing that counts.

`source` records which of the two a stored row is ('user' or 'official'), so
the UI can tell you whether you're looking at your own draft or your locked-in
team rather than silently blurring them.

No auth: anyone who knows an FPL id can read and overwrite that id's draft.
That's inherent to FPL-id-as-identity and is called out in the API docstrings.
